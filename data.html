Self-reported adolescent mental health difficulties and idiographic problems will be assessed at 6 weeks (co-primary outcomes) and again at 12 weeks post-randomization. In addition, adolescent-reported impact of mental health difficulties, perceived stress, mental wellbeing and clinical remission, as well as parent-reported adolescent mental health difficulties and impact scores, will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks post-randomization.

Farmaceutici S.r.l."}},"descriptionModule":{"briefSummary":"Acute viral upper respiratory tract infection, also known as common cold, is the most frequently observed infectious disease in human beings. Although common cold is a self-limiting disease, symptoms such as runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, sore throat, are troublesome.\n\nDry nose is characterized by nasal mucosa dryness, itching, mild burning, crusting, and dehydrated mucus. Causes of dry nose sensation include climatic factors, dry room air, workplace conditions, allergic rhinitis, endonasal sinus surgery.\n\nDry nose symptoms occur concurrently and may be the first signs of a common cold infection and rhinitis sicca (also known atrophic rhinitis).\n\nSaline nasal sprays are broadly used as first-line treatment to relieve nasal congestion or nasal dryness. Isotonic saline solutions preferentially aim at cleansing and moistening of the nasal mucosa and thus are suitable for treatment of dry nose symptoms. Hypertonic saline solutions are generally used for decongestion of the nasal mucosa.\n\nFor these reasons, an interventional, non-comparative, single-center Post Marketing Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study was planned to evaluate the performance and safety of \"NASAL SPRAYS\" used to relieve nasal congestion and dryness.\n\nThe objectives of the PMCF study are confirmation of the performance, collection of additional safety data regarding expected adverse events and detection of potential unexpected adverse events associated with the use of \"NASAL SPRAYS\" according to the instruction for use (IFU).\n\nEach pediatric subject whose parent(s)/legal guardian signed an Informed Consent Form (ICF), and each adult subject after signing the ICF, will enter the screening and baseline phase (the 2 visits will coincide) during which baseline procedures will be completed.\n\nAt baseline visit (V0), one of the \"NASAL SPRAYS\" will be administered to the enrolled subject.\n\nThe patient will perform 2 on-site visits: V0 and V2/EOS. To monitor the safety, 1 phone contact is planned (V1) to check for potential adverse events and concomitant medications intake.\n\nThe first administration and the intervals at which the treatment should be repeated, to be done as per Investigator judgment and according to the IFU, depend on various factors regarding the physiology of the patients (e.g. nasal congestion/ obstruction, sneezing), the age of the patient, and for pediatric subjects, their birth characteristics (e.g. age, prematurity, birthweight)."},"designModule":{"phases":["NA"]},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Nasal sprays with sea salts"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in nasal symptoms:To evaluate the performance of the \"NASAL SPRAYS\" used to relieve nasal congestion and dryness, through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for assessment of nasal symptoms"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pediatric subjects whose ICF will be signed by parent(s) or legal guardian;\n* Adults' ICF signed;\n* M \\& F infants (6-23 months), children (2-11 years), or M \\& F Aged â‰¥ 18 years at the time of the signature of the ICF;\n* Infants, children or adults presenting with nasal congestion and/or nasal dryness.\n* Willingness not to use other nasal sprays during the entire study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Suspected other - different - conditions involving the respiratory tract (e.g. asthma, pneumonia);\n* Suspected or known hypersensitivity or allergy to Investigational Product (IP) components;\n* Suspected alcohol or drug abuse;\n* Other clinically significant and uncontrolled pathologies that may interfere with study results (e.g. cystic fibrosis);\n* Participation in another investigational study;\n* Parent(s)' and/or patient's inability to follow all study procedures, including attending all site visits, tests and examinations;\n* Parent(s)' and/or patient's mental incapacity that precludes adequate understanding or cooperation.","sex":"ALL"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"U.O.C otorinolaringoiatria, Policlinico Mater Domini","city":"Catanzaro"}]}}},

The major risk factor for HIV acquisition among AA women is high-risk heterosexual sex, including unprotected vaginal and anal sex, and sex with a high-risk partner. Hazardous alcohol use has been associated with high risk sexual behaviors and prevalent gonorrhea among women attending an urban STI clinic, both of which increase a woman's vulnerability to HIV acquisition and transmission. This application proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a culturally tailored computer-directed brief alcohol intervention (CBI) enhanced with cell-phone booster calls using interactive voice response technology (IVR) and text messages among HIV-infected and at-risk AA women attending an urban STI Clinic. Hazardous drinking AA women (N=450) presenting with STI complaints will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) usual clinical care, 2) clinic-based, CBI, or 3) clinic-based, CBI + 3 booster calls using IVR and text messages. The CBI, an evidence-based based method for behavior change, will use principles of motivational interviewing, to counsel on: 1) alcohol use and 2) associated HIV/STI risk behaviors. Primary outcomes, measured at 3, 6, and 12 month intervals, include alcohol-related risk behaviors (number of binge drinking episodes, drinking days/week, and drinks per occasion), sexual risk behaviors (number of partners, episodes of unprotected vaginal/anal sex, episodes of sex while high), and occurrence of HIV/STI biomarkers. Prior to implementing the RCT, the CBI and IVR software messages will be revised to: 1) include the association between hazardous alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, and 2) ensure their relevance and acceptability using quantitative/qualitative feedback from a sample of AA women attending a Baltimore City STI clinic. The proposed research focuses on a particularly vulnerable population of urban HIV at-risk and HIV-infected AA women seeking treatment in a public STI clinic and examines two novel BI intervention delivery strategies specifically tailored to be culturally/socially relevant to this minority population. If the intervention(s) prove to be effective, study findings will offer \"real life\" specialty care clinics a screening and intervention package that is practical, low cost, and easy to implement."},"designModule":{"phases":["NA"]},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Computerized brief alcohol intervention + IVR booster calls"},{"name":"Computerized brief alcohol intervention"},{"name":"Attention Control"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Alcohol Use (Heavy Drinking Days)"},{"measure":"Change in Alcohol Use (Drinking Days)"},{"measure":"Change in Alcohol Use (Drinks Per Drinking Day)"},{"measure":"Change in Alcohol Use (Drinks Per Week)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 18 years of age or older;\n2.
